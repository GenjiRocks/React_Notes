    Diffing
    -------
        - the process of comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM

- output should only depend upon arguments
function function_name(){
    js code

 
    return(){  this is the output of the function gets displayed on browser
        jsx display
    }
}

    - the package used is (babel)

Data Sharing:
-------------
    - uni-directional : Parent to Child
    - props : pre-defined object used for data sharing between Parent and Child


Creating a React Application:
    -npx - Node Package Executer
    -npm - Node Package Manager

    - if error npm i -g npm (to make it global)

    - npx create-react-app demo
    -cd demo (to into the project directory)
    -npm start (start the app)

Files Explaination:

 1,README.md - Summarised project description
 2,package.json - npm configurations
        Dependencies include the Libraries required for the project(installed)
        npm start - "react-scripts start" command inside the scripts object

 3,package-lock.json - it holds the library versions
 4,node_modules folder : entire copy of the installed Libraries
 5,.gitignore - ignore the contents to be pushed to github
 6,public folder : Files that can be accessed throughout the application
        -index.html is the only file that run in the browser

    -style = {{property1:value,property2:value}}

    -can also be done by creating the object under the function app and using that name inside the style attribute
- module.css
------------
    -must create in src folder
    -with extension as ".module.css"
    -accessible throughout the application
